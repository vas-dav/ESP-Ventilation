## Embedded Systems Programming Ventilation Project

The objective of this project was to create a smart ventilation system that has the capability to display sensor data and let users set the ventilation fan speed manually, or let the system determine the fan speed in automatic operation by setting the target output air pressure to achieve. This documentation examines the overall system architecture in hardware and software, operation of the system, the development process and goes in detail of the technical implementation. As hardware implementation of this ventilation system is pre-determined, particular attention in this documentation is paid to the embedded software and communications implementation.
